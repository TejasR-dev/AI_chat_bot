# AI_chat_bot
This is a Python automation script that reads chat messages, detects if a specific person (e.g., Rohan Das) sent the last message, and if so â€” generates a hilarious roast reply using Google PaLM (or Gemini). It then automatically pastes and sends the roast back into the chat.

This is for fun and educational purposes. Use responsibly!
